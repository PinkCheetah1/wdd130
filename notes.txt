Portal Page = Portfolio Page (portal to all your projects)

Wireframe = Drawn out design for the page. Where things are, not big details. 

Shift + Alt + Down = Copy line to next line

{ = Squiggle
} = Jiggle
Don't get confused. Jiggle all your Squiggles. 

Little trick for CSS Layout visual guides: 
- Give your boxes an outline (not border - you are less likely to use outline, probably)
- Have a global variable for the color of that outline
- Make that outline 0% opacity when you don't want to see it
- Increase opacity when you need to see the outlines

When working with scalability, is it better to use min/max or %?
